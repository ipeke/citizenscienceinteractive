Welcome to the citizen science interactive wiki!

The dashboard can be reached at: https://citizenscience.shinyapps.io/experiment/

Background: This dashboard was designed and developed by Ipek Ensari and Jordan Siff from Columbia University as a part of a research collaboration with Cassie Quigley, Holly Plank (University of Pittsburgh) and Aileen Owens (EdTech Inc). It aims to facilitate graph literacy and data science skills teaching by integrating topics from environmental sciences and justice, in line with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS; for more information see https://www.nextgenscience.org/). The App was designed to be flexible enough to use for grades 3-8 in teacher-led and peer group activities in the classroom. As such, components of the dashboard range from easy to more advanced topics and we expect some variation in the level of student engagement depending on interest and competency.

What is in the CSI dashboard? In this dashboard, you will find various visualizations related to natural disaster events. Through interacting with the figures and working on answering the research questions associated with the figures, you will learn about fundamental data science concepts and how to read and interpret data plots. You will find out about how natural disasters in the United States might be related to other factors like climate, and their coverage on social media.

How to use the CSI dashboard? For each plot, you will find a set of guiding questions to consider. They aim to first orient you to the plots, and then prompt you to consider various contextual scenarios. In addition to those provided, try to think of other research questions of your own that can be answered using the plots. Finally, consider the following points when attempting to make any inferences based on the plots:

Where do these data come from? How were they collected/recorded?
Consider the time period of data collection/recording. In what ways could this have an influence on the results?
